    /// ||         PPU sprite evaluation. This flag is set during sprite
    /// ||         evaluation and cleared at dot 1 (the second dot) of the
    /// ||         pre-render line.
    /// |+-------- Sprite 0 Hit.  Set when a nonzero pixel of sprite 0 overlaps
    /// |          a nonzero background pixel; cleared at dot 1 of the pre-render
    /// |          line.  Used for raster timing.
